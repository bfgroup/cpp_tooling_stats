Herein we collect and present a variety of performance metrics for {CPP} tools.
The goal is to illuminate the current state of the {CPP} tooling ecosystem to
inform future directions for improvements.

== Tests

=== C++ Modules Performance

This is a collection of measurements for building source that uses the
proposed {CPP} modules feature. So far these are presented as formal
papers submitted for information to WG21 {CPP} standards group.
